# Changelog
This is the official changelog for Shield, all of the new updates shall be placed in this file, along with a description of what I have added.

- I have added a program that sets up a daily cronjob that will run various security based programs and open certain security based logs.
- I have added a program that will install and setup SElinux.
- I have added a program that will setup Two-Factor Authentication.
- I have added a program that will setup email notifications when sudo runs(This is much more useful on a server, but on normally it can still be used to find a piece of malware that is running commands on your computer). 
- I have added a program that will install and setup Open VPN.

Note: This repository will not be actively updated anymore due to the fact that I haven't found anything else to add to this repository and I would like to start working on a new repository. It will however be actively maintained, meaning I will attempt to fix issues, answer questions, etc.
